# threejs-test-project

A sample project demonstrating integration with Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet API for advanced agentic coding and visual simulations using Node.js, React, Three.js, and a Python backend. This project serves as a foundation for leveraging AI capabilities to optimize development workflows—especially when dealing with timeseries RF and neural net data from QuestDB.

## Overview

This repository illustrates how to:
- Integrate Anthropic's API using the official Node.js SDK.
- Build visual simulations with React and Three.js.
- Process timeseries data from QuestDB with a Python backend.
- Securely manage API keys using environment variables.

The goal is to provide a baseline for AI-augmented development, where Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet can help streamline code reviews, debugging, and architectural planning.

## Features

- **Anthropic API Integration:** Use the Anthropic SDK to interact with Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
- **Visual Simulations:** A starting point for creating immersive visual simulations using React and Three.js.
- **Secure Configuration:** Environment variables (via a `.env` file) to securely store your Anthropic API key.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Designed for expansion—integrate additional tools, CI/CD pipelines, and custom AI-driven workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- An Anthropic API key (available via your Anthropic Console)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bgilbert1984/threejs-test-project.git
